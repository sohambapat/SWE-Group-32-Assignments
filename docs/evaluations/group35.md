|Video1| For people starting with 2020 or 2021 projects, 2min video of old functionality|0| 
|Video2|For people starting with 2020 or 2021 projects, 2min video of new functionality, showing a significant delta from old. For everyone else, 2min video of all functionality.|0| 
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... ||3|
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence in GH|3|
|Number of commits|in GH|41|
|Number of commits: by different people|in GH|3|
|Issues reports: there are **many**||0|
|Issues are being closed|evidence in GH|0|
|DOI badge: exists|in GH|1|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |in GH|0|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) ||0|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|0|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing||0|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.||0|
|Use of version control tools||3|
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|3|
|Use of code formatters. |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|3|
|Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |3|
|Use of code coverage |config files in GH|3|
|Other automated analysis tools|config files in GH|3|
|Test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|3|
|Test cases are routinely executed|E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|3|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up||3|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|0|
|Chat channel: exists|Link or screenshots|0|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|3|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files||3|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)||3|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)||3|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base||3|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|0|
